# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
Simple ML project about Titanic survival prediction using Random Forest, which show cases basic data processing and model evaluation.

## Dataset 
The dataset was from https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic.csv.
Several preprocessing for the dataset was needed, such as

1. Mapping textual data ('Sex' & 'Embarked') to numerical values.
